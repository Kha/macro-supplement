# Supplemental material for the "Beyond Notations" paper/thesis chapter

This repository contains the full bigop example (`Bigop.lean`), the
example expander (`Expander.lean`), and other examples from the
text (`Examples.lean`).

For setting up Lean 4 together with an editor, please see
https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html. When you open this
supplement as a folder in the last step, the `elan` version manager will
automatically download a version of Lean compatible with the supplement.
